# Cat Photo Ranking App

The internet loves cats! Come check out as many cat photos as you need to get you through the day :)

## Approach Taken

K.I.S.S it! Keep it simple stupid. To start off this project, I created the bare bones to meet MVP. The functionality is low, but the cuteness is off the charts!! 

This project uses React on Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Faker, the CatAPI (for photos), Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
